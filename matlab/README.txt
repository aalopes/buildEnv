To run the 'program' begin by running start.m.
This will set your path appropriately and provide you a list of functions and
tests. 

This buildEnv also allows you to easily work with external C libraries,
either in Linux or Windows and to create executable Matlab files including
executables using these libraries (through the use of thunk files, see 
generate_prototype.m in ./lib).
It comes with some scripts to that effect.

Tested with Matlab R2014a on Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 10 (both x86-64).
