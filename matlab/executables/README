To generate Matlab executables (and hence avoid the need to use Licenses),
generate the prototype file and thunk library file by executing the 
'generate_prototype.m' file in Matlab. Then run the 'compile_test.sh'
script on the desired .m script. The executable will be copied to this
folder. Note that if using different libraries, you will need to adapt
the 'compile_test.sh' script to your needs.
